The **logic used in a Donation Management System** involves several core modules working together to ensure smooth handling of donors, donations, campaigns, and reports. Below is a breakdown of the **key logic and workflows** typically used in such software:

---

## üß† **Core Logic Used in Donation Management System**

### 1. **User Authentication & Roles**

* **Logic**:

  * Verify login credentials (admin, donor, volunteer).
  * Role-based access control (only admins can create campaigns, for example).
* **Technologies**: JWT tokens / Session-based login / OAuth

---

### 2. **Donor Management**

* **Logic**:

  * Register donor with personal details.
  * Retrieve, update, or delete donor information.
  * Track donation history per donor.

---

### 3. **Donation Processing**

* **Logic**:

  * Accept donation input (amount, donor, payment method, campaign).
  * Validate fields (e.g., amount must be numeric and > 0).
  * Store donation data with timestamp and transaction ID.
  * Trigger confirmation email or receipt generation.
* **Payment Integration**: (if online)

  * Integrate with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay, etc.)
  * Logic to handle success/failure callbacks.

---

### 4. **Campaign Management**

* **Logic**:

  * Admin can create/update/delete donation campaigns.
  * Link donations to specific campaigns.
  * Display progress:
    `progress = (sum of campaign donations / campaign goal) * 100`
  * Option to show/hide completed campaigns.

---

### 5. **Receipt & Acknowledgment**

* **Logic**:

  * Auto-generate donation receipt with donor info, amount, date.
  * Send via email or downloadable PDF.
  * Assign unique receipt numbers.

---

### 6. **Reports and Analytics**

* **Logic**:

  * Generate reports based on:

    * Date range
    * Campaign
    * Donor
    * Payment method
  * Example queries:

    * Total donations this month
    * Top 5 donors
    * Campaign with highest funds raised
* **Graphs and Charts**: Visualize trends using charting libraries.

---

### 7. **Data Validation & Security**

* **Logic**:

  * Sanitize user inputs (prevent XSS, SQL injection).
  * Encrypt sensitive donor data.
  * Secure endpoints with authentication middleware.

---

### 8. **Notification System (Optional)**

* **Logic**:

  * Trigger email/SMS when:

    * A donation is received.
    * A campaign goal is reached.
    * A donor receives a receipt or thank-you message.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Pseudo-Logic for Donation Flow

```pseudo
IF user submits donation form:
    VALIDATE form data
    IF valid:
        PROCESS payment (if online)
        IF payment successful:
            STORE donation in database
            UPDATE campaign total
            SEND receipt to donor
        ELSE:
            SHOW payment failed message
    ELSE:
        SHOW validation error
```
